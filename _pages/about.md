I am Ajoy Karmakar, a budding researcher passionate about understanding short-term ecological processes through purely observational data and exploring long-term phenomena using modeling techniques. My work bridges empirical observation, remote sensing, and numerical modeling to gain deeper insights into biogeochemical processes.
